<p>OWNCOMPUTER is an application that generates an interface for the correct choice of components to create a functional computer equipment.</p>
<p>From the outset, the two File and Help buttons are found in the app's navigation bar.</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>"File"</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>button contains two buttons,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>"New"</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>And<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>"Exit"</strong>: -<strong>"New"</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>allows us to empty the entire interface to create a new budget. -<strong>"Exit"</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>allows us to exit the application.</p>
<p>Just below, and in a black bar, we find the button<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>"First, select the</strong><strong>&nbsp;settings"</strong>, which gives us the option to choose an initial configuration of sockets, hard-disk and type RAM through a drop-down for, later, the available options of elements that are compatible with our initial configuration are opened.</p>
<p>Once the initial configuration has been chosen, we have 9 buttons with their respective components to choose from, fully compatible with our choice.</p>
<ol>
<li>The button "cpu" gives us the option to choose processor options with their respective prices</li>
<li>The "motherboard" button gives us the option to choose processor options with their respective prices.</li>
<li>The "hard-disk" button gives us the option to choose hard disk options with their respective prices.</li>
<li>The "ram" button gives us the option to choose ram memory options with their respective prices.</li>
<li>The "graphic card" button gives us the option to choose graphic card options with their respective prices.</li>
<li>The "power supply" button gives us the option to choose power supply options with their respective prices.</li>
<li>The "case" button gives us the option to choose case options with their respective prices.</li>
<li>The "heat-sinks" button gives us the option to choose liquid cooling options with their respective prices.</li>
<li>The button "other devices" gives us the option to choose monitor options with their respective prices</li>
</ol>
<p>In the empty frame at the beginning of the left, the elements that we are selecting appear and we add for the future delivery note. Just below we find the "total" box where we are shown the total price of all selected components</p>
<p><em>Last but not least</em>, we find four buttons at the bottom right hand side</p>
<ul>
<li>The white cross with a green background is the add button, which we will use to add to the "cart" all the components we need</li>
<li>The white line on a red background allows us to remove items from the cart, in case the need arises</li>
<li>The white question mark on an orange background shows us the technical specifications of the component that we have selected.</li>
<li>The button "create budget" will generate the invoice with all the elements that we have selected at the end of the selection</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last line at the bottom of the application page, we see a line with the rights reserved to OWNCOMPUTER</p>
